# FPS_cmd
I implemented a 2.5D game using nothing but C++

# Installation
* No specific software is required to run this, just download the code and run it on your windows machine

**Note: this would work only on a _windows_ machine**

# Brief Description from the image:
* I had used unicode to mark the walls with different levels of opacity according to the distance of the player from them
* I used regular ASCII letters for te floor to give a psuedo depth of feel effect.

Special thanks to @onelonecoder I coudn't have done it without his tutorials.
