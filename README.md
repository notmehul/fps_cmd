# FPS_cmd
I implemented a 2.5D game using nothing but C++

# Installation
* No specific software is required to run this, just download the code and run it on your windows machine

**Note: this would work only on a _windows_ machine**

# Brief Description from the image:
*I had used unicode to mark the walls with different levels of opacity according to the distance of the player from them
*I used regular ASCII letters for te floor to give a psuedo depth of feel effect.

# Updates to come in the future:
*proper layout of maps with enemies and such.
*implementing a weapon.
